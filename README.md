# PyBer RideShare Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to provide a summary DataFrame and visual of the total weekly fares per city type for PyBer, a ridesharing platform.

## Results 
Among the 3 city types, there were more rides in the urban type than rural (13 times more) and suburban (2 times more). It is not without surprise as there were more drivers in the urban type than rural or suburban. With more rides and more drivers, the urban type was able to bring in more money and so average fare per ride and average per driver were lower in the urban type than in the rural or suburban. Conversely, the rural type had the least amount of rides and drivers, therefore bringing in the least amount of money, resulting in the highest average fare per ride and per driver.

## Summary
The obvious yet challenging issue to resolve to address disparities among city types would be to increase the number of drivers to help bring down costs per ride and cost per driver. However, if there is no demand for ridesharing in rural communities, increasing the number of drivers would make the problem worse. Perhaps in these communities, ridesharing may not be necessary but another form of shared vehicles may be of use. Looking strictly from January to April, there was a little rise in February, possibly attributed to holiday travel so providing holiday and other incentives may help attract customers.

Due to bugs I was unable to decode, the final summary DataFrame and line graph are not available; however, the code I used is found here, should any advice be available on how to decode my issues
